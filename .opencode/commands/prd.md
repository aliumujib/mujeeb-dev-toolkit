agent: build

# PRD Loop

Execute the setup script to initialize the PRD loop:

```bash
!`./scripts/setup-prd.sh $ARGUMENTS`
```

You are now in a phased PRD workflow. Follow the phases below based on **structured output markers**.

---

## Branch Setup (Handled by Setup Script)

When starting on main/master, the setup script prompts:
1. "Create a feature branch?" [1/2]
2. If yes, prompts for branch name (default: `feat/<feature-name>`)
3. Creates branch before loop starts

---

## Structured Output Control Flow

Use **file existence as primary truth** (ralph-loop pattern). Markers are for explicit control. If you complete the work but forget the marker, detect file existence and auto-advance (where allowed).

### Phase Transition Table

| Phase | Name | Required Marker | Attributes | Next Phase |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Input Classification | `<phase_complete phase="1"/>` | `feature_name` (required) | 2 |
| 2 | Interview + Exploration | `<phase_complete phase="2"/>` | none | 3 |
| 3 | Spec Write | `<phase_complete phase="3"/>` | `spec_path` (required) | 4 |
| 4 | Dex Handoff | `<phase_complete phase="4"/>` | none | done |

### Detection Priority (File > Marker)

1. **File existence is truth** - If `plans/<feature>/spec.md` exists, phase 3 is considered complete
2. **Markers are explicit signals** - Still work and take precedence when present
3. **Last marker wins** - If docs/examples contain markers, only the LAST occurrence counts
4. **Auto-discovery** - Paths follow convention: `plans/<feature>/spec.md`

### CRITICAL: Marker Placement

**Phase markers MUST be the LAST thing in your response.** If you output a marker then make a tool call, the marker won't be detected.

Correct:
```
[Complete phase work]
[Final summary text]
<phase_complete phase="2"/>
```

Wrong:
```
<phase_complete phase="2"/>
[Tool call after marker] <- Marker missed!
```

### File-Based Auto-Advance

| Phase | Auto-Advances When |
|-------|-------------------|
| 3 | `plans/<feature>/spec.md` exists with stories section |
| 4 | Dex tasks created for all stories |

### Exact Marker Formats

```xml
<!-- Phase 1 -->
<phase_complete phase="1" feature_name="auth-feature"/>

<!-- Phase 2 -->
<phase_complete phase="2"/>

<!-- Phase 3 -->
<phase_complete phase="3" spec_path="plans/auth-feature/spec.md"/>

<!-- Phase 4 -->
<phase_complete phase="4"/>
```

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Input Classification

Classify input type (empty/file/folder/idea) and extract feature context.

**Output:** `<phase_complete phase="1" feature_name="SLUG"/>` where SLUG is lowercase-hyphenated.

### Phase 2: Interview + Exploration

**Commitment:** "I will ask 8-10+ questions covering: core problem, success criteria, MVP scope, technical constraints, UX flows, edge cases, error states, and tradeoffs. After interview, I will run research agents to inform the spec."

Conduct thorough interview:

#### Interview (8-10+ questions across these areas):
- **Core** - Problem statement, success criteria, MVP scope
- **Technical** - Systems, data models, existing patterns
- **UX/UI** - User flows, error states, edge cases
- **Tradeoffs** - Compromises, priorities, constraints

#### After Interview Complete, Run Agents (blocking)

Spawn ALL agents IN PARALLEL (single message, multiple Task calls). User waits ~2-3 min while agents research.

**Research Agents:**
```
Task 1: @prd-codebase-researcher (explore the codebase for patterns)
Task 2: @explore (analyze git history for prior attempts)
Task 3: @prd-external-researcher (research best practices)
```

#### Review Findings

After agents complete, summarize key findings briefly.

**If findings reveal gaps:**
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Wait for user response
3. THEN output the marker in your next response

**If no gaps:**
Output the marker immediately.

**IMPORTANT:** The marker must be the LAST thing in your response with NO tool calls after it.

**Output:** `<phase_complete phase="2"/>`

### Phase 3: Spec Write

Write comprehensive spec to `plans/<feature>/spec.md`. Include a structured stories section for Dex parsing.

**Spec Structure:**
```markdown
# <Feature> Specification

## Overview
## Problem Statement
## Success Criteria
## User Stories (As a X, I want Y, so that Z)
## Detailed Requirements
### Functional Requirements
### Non-Functional Requirements
### UI/UX Specifications
## Technical Design
### Data Models
### API Contracts
### System Interactions
### Implementation Notes
## Edge Cases & Error Handling
## Open Questions
## Out of Scope

## Implementation Stories

### Story 1: <Title>
**Category:** functional|ui|integration|edge-case|performance
**Skills:** <skill-name>, <skill-name>
**Blocked by:** none
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

### Story 2: <Title>
**Category:** <category>
**Skills:** <skills or none>
**Blocked by:** Story 1
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ...

## Research Findings
## Expert Review Findings
## References
```

**Story Size Rules:**
- Each story = ONE task (~15-30 min work)
- Max 7 acceptance criteria - if more, split
- Max 3 files touched - if more, consider splitting
- No "and" in title - "User can X and Y" = two stories
- Independently testable, cleanly revertible

**Marker:** After writing the spec file, output the marker with NO tool calls after it:
```
<phase_complete phase="3" spec_path="plans/<feature>/spec.md"/>
```

### Phase 4: Dex Handoff

Use `dex plan` to create tasks from the spec's Implementation Stories section.

**Steps:**

1. Parse spec and create tasks:
```bash
dex plan plans/<feature>/spec.md
```

This automatically:
- Creates parent task from spec title
- Analyzes Implementation Stories section
- Creates subtasks for each story with context
- Reports task IDs and structure

2. Add blocked-by relationships if needed:
```bash
# If stories have dependencies (from "Blocked by:" in spec):
dex edit <story2-id> --add-blocker <story1-id>
```

3. Verify tasks created:
```bash
dex status
dex list
```

4. Ask user what's next:
"PRD complete! Dex tasks created. What next?"

Options:
- **Start first task** - Begin implementation
- **Done** - Review PRD first, implement later

5. **AFTER user responds**, output the completion marker:
- If "Done": Output `<promise>PRD COMPLETE</promise>`
- If "Start first task": Output `<phase_complete phase="4"/>` then begin implementation

**IMPORTANT:** The marker/promise must be output AFTER the user responds, not before.

## Key Principles

**Production Quality Always** - Every line will be maintained by others.

**Be Annoyingly Thorough** - Better 20 questions than one missed detail.

**Non-Obvious > Obvious** - Focus on edge cases, error states, tradeoffs.

**Expert Input Early** - Run reviewers during exploration, not after spec is done.

**Atomic Stories** - Each story = ONE thing, ONE task. Independently testable, cleanly revertible.
